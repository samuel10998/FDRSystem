If you want to run this app use Docker desktop + for example Intellij (recommended)

When downloading this project run these commands in console:
1. docker compose build  
2. docker compose up    

If you wanna remove the container I reccomend using docker compose down -v (so it removes also all the volumes especially where User profile pictures are stored.)

Then go to your Docker desktop and click on (backend, frontend, databaze[mysql] or smtp4dev[for verifying emails] ports).
